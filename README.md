# CHAOSS-project
The repository contains solutions for micro tasks  given by CHAOSS project

In the following project I try to address the following tasks:

Microtask 1 (done): Produce a listing of the number of new committers per month, and the number of commits for each of them, as a table and as a CSV file. Use the GrimoireLab enriched index for git.

Microtask 2 (in progress): Produce a chart showing the distribution of time-to-close (using the corresponding field in the GrimoireLab enriched index for GitHub issues) for issues already closed, and opened during the last six months.

The solutions are included in the respective directories.
